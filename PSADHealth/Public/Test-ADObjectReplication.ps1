    .SYNOPSIS
    Monitor AD Object Replication
    
    .DESCRIPTION
    Each run of the script creates a unique test object in the domain, and tracks it's replication to all other DCs in the domain.
    By default it will query the DCs for about 60 minutes.  If after 60 loops the object hasn't repliated the test will terminate and create an alert.

    .EXAMPLE
    Run as a scheduled task.  Use Event Log consolidation tools to pull and alert on issues found.

    .EXAMPLE
    Run in verbose mode if you want on-screen feedback for testing
   
    .EXAMPLE
    PS C:\> $trigger = New-JobTrigger -Once -At 6:30AM -RepetitionInterval (New-TimeSpan -Hours 24) -RepeatIndefinitely
    PS C:\> $cred = Get-Credential DOMAIN\ServiceAccount
    PS C:\> $opt = New-ScheduledJobOption -RunElevated -RequireNetwork
    PS C:\> Register-ScheduledJob -Name Test-ADObjectReplication -Trigger $trigger -Credential $cred -ScriptBlock {(Import-Module -Name PSADHealth); Test-ADObjectReplication} -MaxResultCount 5 -ScheduledJobOption $opt

    Creates a scheduled task to run Test-ADObjectReplication on a daily basis. NOTE: Service account needs to be a Domain Admin or equivalent (Tier0) and must have the RunAsBatch and RunAsService privilege

    Version: 0.6.3
    Version Date: 04/18/2019

    This script must be run from a Win10, or Server 2016 system.  It can target older OS Versions.

    Event Source 'PSMonitor' will be created

    EventID Definition:
    17010 - Failure
    17011 - Cycle Count
    17012 - Test Object not yet on DC
    17013 - Test Object on DC
    17014 - Tests didn't complete in alloted time span
    17015 - Job output
    17016 - Test Object Created
    17017 - Test Object Deleted
    17018 - 1 minute Sleep
    17019 - Posible old object detected

    Updated: 05/29/2020
        Silenced the import of ActiveDirectory module because we don't really want to see that
        Added "Silently loaded ActiveDirectory module" statement in its place
        Primarily adding -Message for good code hygiene and expanding any aliases
        Added a few more verbose statements for derived information
        All in all, this function already had pretty good verbosity
        Send-AlertCleared was not passing the $InError variable (I think this is a Script to Function issue). Corrected
